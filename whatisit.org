#+title: What is this?

* Sketch of what this is.

 * This could be a 'souls-like', where you swing a sword back and
   forth.
 * This could be a card game, where combat is through cards.
 * I want this to be a skill game, where you have blocking, parrying,
   and attacking.
 * It could be a top down game, where the crank turns your direction.
   The dpad moves you relative to your facing direction, and the A and
   B button could be for whatever.
 * What if it was a magic game? You collect spells in your
   spellbook. Perhaps you perform spells with the crank by pressing A
   at particular places on the crank-cycle in a particular order to
   cast spells.
 * I will do this all. The first thing is melee though. I am
   considering an angled POV, but then there is some fun matrix math
   to be had. IT is either that or totally top down. I think that the
   top of the screen is going to be the farthest from the player, and
   all the sprites over  there will be scaled appropriately. 
 * It would certainly be very cool if there was perspective of the
   trees, although it would be kinda hard to see and understand them.
 * scratch all of that, this is a 100% top down zelda soulslike. Swing
   your sword with momentum of the crank and go ham.
